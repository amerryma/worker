# Gra*fast* Website

This website is built using [Docusaurus 2](https://docusaurus.io/), a modern
static website generator.

### Installation

Git clone the entire worker repo, not just this website directory.

Run the yarn commands in the root folder, not `/website`.

To install:

```
$ yarn
```

### Local Development

```
$ yarn website start
```

This command starts a local development server and opens up a browser window.
Most changes are reflected live without having to restart the server.

### Build

```
$ yarn website build
```

This command generates static content into the `build` directory and can be
served using any static contents hosting service.
