Graphile Worker does not require a configuration file, but you may find that
having a configuration file means you don't have to remember all the CLI flags
each time you run it.

Graphile Worker is configured via a `graphile.config.js` (or `.ts`, `.mjs`, ...)
file. This file must export a "Graphile Config preset" which is a POJO (plain
old JavaScript object) containing keys such as `extends` (to merge in extra
presets), `plugins` (to add plugins) and in our case `worker` which contains the
settings for Graphile Worker.

## Options

The options are documented via TypeScript, hover an option in your editor to see
what it does.

TODO: detail the options here, in an autogenerated/maintainable way.

## Examples

Here's an example in JavaScript:

```ts title="graphile.config.js"
module.exports = {
  worker: {
    connectionString: process.env.DATABASE_URL,
    maxPoolSize: 10,
    pollInterval: 2000,
    preparedStatements: true,
    schema: "graphile_worker",
    crontabFile: "crontab",
    concurrentJobs: 1,
    fileExtensions: [".js", ".cjs", ".mjs"],
  },
};
```

And an equivalent configuration in TypeScript:

```ts title="graphile.config.ts"
import type {} from "graphile-config";
import type {} from "graphile-worker";

const preset: GraphileConfig.Preset = {
  worker: {
    connectionString: process.env.DATABASE_URL,
    maxPoolSize: 10,
    pollInterval: 2000,
    preparedStatements: true,
    schema: "graphile_worker",
    crontabFile: "crontab",
    concurrentJobs: 1,
    fileExtensions: [".js", ".cjs", ".mjs"],
  },
};

export default preset;
```

:::info

TypeScript uses the imports just so it understands what options are available,
these will not be included in the output JavaScript.
