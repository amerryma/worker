We currently use the formula `exp(least(10, attempt))` to determine the delays
between attempts (the job must fail before the next attempt is scheduled, so the
total time elapsed may be greater depending on how long the job runs for before
it fails). This seems to handle temporary issues well, after ~4 hours attempts
will be made every ~6 hours until the maximum number of attempts is achieved.
The specific delays can be seen below:

```
select
  attempt,
  exp(least(10, attempt)) * interval '1 second' as delay,
  sum(exp(least(10, attempt)) * interval '1 second') over (order by attempt asc) total_delay
from generate_series(1, 24) as attempt;

 attempt |      delay      |   total_delay
