Production ready (and used in production).

We&apos;re still enhancing/iterating the library rapidly, hence the 0.x
numbering; updating to a new &ldquo;minor&rdquo; version (0.y) may require some
small code modifications, particularly to TypeScript type names; these are
documented in the
[release notes](https://github.com/graphile/worker/blob/main/RELEASE_NOTES.md).

To give feedback please raise an issue, or reach out
