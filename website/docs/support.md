## Getting support

If searching the docs and issues doesn't help; you should consider asking for
help from the community on [the Graphile Discord](https://discord.gg/graphile).

Professional support contracts are also available; for more information see:
https://graphile.org/support/

## Giving support

Please support development of this project
[via sponsorship](https://graphile.org/sponsor/). With your support we can
improve performance, usability and documentation at a greater rate, leading to
reduced running and engineering costs for your organisation, leading to a net
ROI.

If you can't help with sponsorship, then helping others with their problems on
the GitHub issues and in [the Graphile Discord](https://discord.gg/graphile) are
both appreciated.
