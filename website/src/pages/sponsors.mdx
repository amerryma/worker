Graphile has a number of crowd-funded open-source projects, licensed under the
permissive MIT license, including PostGraphile, Graphile Worker, Graphile
Migrate and Graphile Starter. Sponsorship increases the rate of fixes,
documentation improvements, and feature development on these and other projects.
